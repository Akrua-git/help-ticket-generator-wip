There isnt much to this project, its not serious or anything.

I'm just trying to get a log of my progress as I get better with scripting in python, this was just a random project I started.
I honestly didnt even have a plan when I started making this, my goal with this was to get more comfortable with using classes, and i think it helped out well.
I do plan on eventually finishing this and creating a proper system for ticket retrieval on the support side, but I have a couple other projects I would like to work on before I put too much into this one.

One thing I will say, is for this to work, you will need to make a file 'ticket number.txt' and simply type whatever number you want to start with for assigning to tickets and save it before running the script, though this is just a start to this system, its not anywhere near being properly functional.

Thanks for taking time to check this out.
